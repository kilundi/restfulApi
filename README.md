**RESTful API with Django**

This repository contains the source code for a RESTful API built using Django. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources such as blog posts.

**Demo**

A live demo of the API is available at [https://restfulapi-kmic.onrender.com/](https://restfulapi-kmic.onrender.com/). Feel free to explore the endpoints and interact with the API.

**Features**

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on resources.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure endpoints using token-based authentication and restrict access based on user roles.
- **Validation**: Validate incoming requests to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Pagination**: Handle large datasets efficiently by paginating query results.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Filter and sort resources based on specified criteria.
- **API Documentation**: Automatically generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or Django Rest Framework's browsable API.

**Installation**

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run migrations to create the database schema:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/`.

**Usage**

1. Create a user account or authenticate using existing credentials.
2. Explore the available endpoints for different resources (e.g., blog posts).
3. Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the API.
4. Include authentication tokens in request headers for protected endpoints.
